# Spotify Web Player Clone (Frontend Project)

A fully responsive Spotify-inspired web music player built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project focuses on front-end fundamentals, DOM manipulation, media handling, and responsive UI design without using any external frameworks or libraries.

## Over View

The application plays locally stored audio files organized by artist folders and dynamically updates the UI based on user interaction
